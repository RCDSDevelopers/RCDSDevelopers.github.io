    <p>College is a hard conversation to have and everyone will be asking you about it.  Here is how to have some tough conversations with different people.</p>

<h1 id="with-yourself">With yourself</h1>

<p>Be honest. What are your strengths and what are your weaknesses? Have this conversation with yourself before hand and don’t hold back. This will help you begin to think about your future and where you see yourself in 5 years. Be honest about your level of independence, maturity and the support systems you depend on. When you’re researching, analyze what are your reach, fit and safety schools are.</p>

<p>Be self-challenging. Ideally, this is where you will be spending the next four years of your life. Think about the environment that you see yourself thriving in, the people you’d like to be surrounded with, and push yourself to try something new.</p>

<p>Be patient. You might not figure out what your perfect college is and you might not know what you want to study. Give yourself time to research and ask questions. But don’t force yourself to apply early decision somewhere and don’t force yourself to fall in love with a school. Everyone’s process is different; don’t set expectations for yourself, just go with the flow.</p>

<h1 id="with-your-family">With your family</h1>
<p>Communicate to your family members on what kind of support you will need from them throughout this process. Tell them about your goals and aspirations so that they can help you navigate colleges. However, remember that this is your process and it is your future you are working towards.</p>

<p>Everyone will ask you where you want to go. This might create some pressure and you need to learn how to deal with it. Either be honest and tell them your plans, or have a backup school that you mention to avoid awkwardness.</p>

<h1 id="your-friendspeers">Your friends/peers</h1>
<p>Don’t compare yourself to others. Your peers may have different aspirations and desires for themselves. Don’t take on their expectations as the ultimate ones.</p>
