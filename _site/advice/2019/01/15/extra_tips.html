<p>Listen to soothing music</p>

<p>Try to write at least one draft of personal essay and some supplements in the summer.  You’ll thank yourself later if you get ahead in the summer.  If you can, just bang out like five personal essays and pick the best one.  Oftentimes you’ll be able to use the other ones for supplements.</p>

<p>Mental health days are valid.  If you need to take time off of school for yourself, do it.</p>

<p>Meet with your teachers and tell them how you are feeling. They are understanding, amazing people who will help you in any way they can.</p>

<p>Take notes during information sessions (when a college representative  comes to visit RCDS)</p>
