    <p>It takes about roughly two months to receive a decision letter. They’re usually posted online or by letter. This can be very nerve racking, but reacting to any outcome in the right way is important.</p>

<h1 id="acceptance">Acceptance</h1>
<p>Of course it is important to be happy and show how enthusiastic you are if you are accepted. It’s great to celebrate with family and friends. However, others might not have the same outcome as you, so your enthusiasm can hurt others, especially if others applied to the same school.</p>

<p>Don’t exploit your acceptance to everyone, but the people who you know will take your acceptance in a positive way. You never know what is going on in another’s life our their college experience, so going out of your way to talk about your acceptance can be seen as annoying or rude.  Try your best to avoid talking about your acceptance with people who you know applied to the same college and don’t ask others about their decision outcomes unless they told you to ask beforehand.</p>

<h1 id="rejections">Rejections</h1>

<p>Rejection can be tough, but DO not worry and DO not get sad because there are so many other schools. Wherever you end up you will love and you can’t be let down by another’s school’s decision.</p>

<p>Throw out that letter and make the most of the one you are accepted to because college is all about what you make of it.  If someone asks you about if you were accepted or rejected, answer on what your feelings regarding this situation are. If you are an open book then illustrate the decision</p>

<p>If you don’t want to exploit your rejection just respond saying “I’m keeping my college decisions to myself,” and they should understand.</p>

<h1 id="deferral">Deferral</h1>

<p>Hang in there. You are not accepted nor rejected, but you are just put into the regular decision pool. Take this as a positive because the school still thinks highly of you, but couldn’t accept you early. You still have the same chance you did before.</p>

<p>It might be tough waiting another two or so months, but it is better than being rejected. You still are in the running!!!!</p>
