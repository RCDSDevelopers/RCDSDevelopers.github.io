Before paying for flights or looking for hotels make sure you RESEARCH every school you think you are interested into.

Research what is important to you. Some might be:
- School spirit
- Majors
- Classes
- Professors
- Internships
- Location
- Class size
- Diversity
- Financial Aid
- Extracurriculars  

After you research all of the above and are happy with your results apply to those schools

You do not necessarily have to visit the school!  The college process is expensive!!! You have to take into consideration everything when you are deciding on the right school for you.  You do not need to visit all of the schools you applied to. Transportation is very very expensive, as well as the hotel you stay in when visiting campus.

For me, my mom would not allow me to visit all of the schools on my list. In fact, I only visited one.  Once you get into the schools, then you can go visit the school. Otherwise you wasted a trip and money visiting a school you are not accepted to.  Once you visit 3-4 schools they all start to look the same.

Just because all of your friends are visiting schools does not mean you have to. Don't feel pressured or bad because you didn't. It's a normal thing not to visit all of the schools that you are applying to. Don't feel pressured to visit all of your schools
