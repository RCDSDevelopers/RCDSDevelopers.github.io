# General Tips

Try to have a list of schools you want to apply to by the start of summer.  Supplements for most colleges come out August 1st

Do your best to finish taking standardized test before senior year.  However not the end of the world if you don’t.  KEEP GRINDING!!

It can be really hard to keep working as hard as you can when it feels like it’s never ending, but in the end it will pay off.

Stay on your own path.  During this process, it’s really easy to compare yourself to your friends or other people who are applying but just try to block everyone else out.  Your process is going to be different than your friends so don’t compare yourself.
