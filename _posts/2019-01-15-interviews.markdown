There’s no one secret that’ll cause you to completely nail any interview thrown at you.  Every interview and interviewer will bring something different to the table, but there are some key things you might want to do to help give your interviewer the best possible impression of you.

# Preparation

When you’re scheduling your interview, make sure to use proper email educate.  It’s so obvious, but misspelling words can be costly on your first impression.  Also remember to reply with quote just to make their lives easier.  Hopefully they’ll take the initiative in laying out some possible times to meet with them, but if they ask that you provide some time you’re free, try to give many options as abstractly as possible “I’m free on Saturdays in the morning and late afternoon as well as all day Sunday.”

Don’t overdress or underdress.  Look nice, but you don’t want to come across as needy or pretentious with your outfit.  You should dress up, but if you stick out like a sore thumb at whatever location you’re meeting your interviewer, it’s probably a good sign that you’ve overdressed.  For example, if you’re interviewing in a coffee shop, a suit and tie might be a bit overkill, but a nice sweater or button-down can blend in without looking overdressed.

Be ready to answer the “why X college” question.  There is always something specific about this college that is unlike most other colleges for you to talk about.  It can be something like a specific program, but if it is, make sure to explain how that relates to your goals as a whole or the college as a whole.  For example, “The main thing that got me interested in this college is their dual engineering and entrepreneurship program, because there really aren’t many other colleges where I can learn both disciplines to such a rigorous extent to prepare me to launch my own company when I graduate.”

Be ready to ask questions about the college.  Interviewers will almost always end the interview with, “so in the last few minutes I was wondering if you had any questions for me.”  These should be things you can’t get from the admission website.  For example, “it’s really hard to get a sense of the culture of the school without meeting people who went there and I frankly haven’t had the ability to talk to many people who have, so I was wondering if you could give any insights on what the school culture is like.”  Feel free to ask about the interviewer's time in college as well.  Remember, these are people who voluntarily interview high schoolers in order to benefit their university, meaning that they really enjoyed their time and would love any chance to reminisce on it.  Asking them about their time is a surefire way to get them more engaged.

# What to bring
See what the college’s policy is on resumes.  9 times out of 10 they would like one or at the very least would take one.  It should look clean, ideally stored in a folder, and no more than a page front and back.

Bring a pen and a notepad.  Maybe you’ll have something insightful to write down or maybe not.  At the very least, you’ll look prepared.

Make it into a show and tell.  If you have an object or some pictures that really capture your high school career, bring it to your interview.  Maybe it’s your art portfolio or something you built; either way it’s great to facilitate discussion.  If you’re showing them pictures on your phone, make a new album of pictures exclusively for interviews just in case they try to scroll through your photos.

# The interview itself

Be early.  The worst possible situation is trying to show up 5 minutes before the interview and being stuck looking for parking.  Give yourself at least fifteen minutes beforehand to make sure you’re near where you need to be with a comfortable amount of time to spare.  Being even a little late looks bad and first impressions are important.

Don’t psych yourself out.  It’s just a conversation.  Almost all interviewers are incredibly pleasant people to talk to and they just want to get a good sense of you.  Talk about yourself and the things you’re passionate about.  Have a good body of anecdotes that you can bring up for certain situations.  Don’t memorize them but be ready to pull one out and tell it at a moments notice.

If you ever catch yourself stretching the truth a little bit, don’t panic.  Try to move onto another topic or anecdote in a way that’s not too forced so that you don’t dig yourself into a hole.

Be conscious of your body language.  Don’t slouch into your chair or fidget with anything.  Try to mirror your interviewer’s posture if relevant.  In other words, if they're leaning back you might not want to sit all the way up and towards the table.  Do try to maintain eye contact whenever possible, especially if they’re the ones talking.
Don’t feel too bad about telling them your accomplishments.  False modesty is something many of us use in our daily lives.  If you did something awesome, tell them that.  If you feel like you might be bragging, you’ll have to read the conversation to see how to talk about your accomplishments.  A good rule of thumb is that if it directly answers their question and is completely true, then it’s not bragging.
Start and end the conversation with firm handshakes and “thank you”s.  It’s not the biggest deal, but a good first impression is always important.

# After the interview

Send a thank you email.  It isn’t the biggest gesture but it’s always appreciated.  These should be short and relevant to your discussion.  Maybe mention that you’re grateful for them offering their opinion on X aspect of the school.  It can be brief, maybe 3 or so sentences, but it can have a large effect as not all applicants send these.
