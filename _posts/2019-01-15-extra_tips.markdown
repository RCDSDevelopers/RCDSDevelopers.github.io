Yes you will freak out, yes might have some breakdowns, yes you may cry and turn into a sassy and rude teenager but everything will be okay.  Everyone will end up where they are supposed to be and college isn't the end of the world.  We're in a community that values college to such an unhealthy degree.

Listen to soothing music

Try to write at least one draft of personal essay and some supplements in the summer.  You'll thank yourself later if you get ahead in the summer.  If you can, just bang out like five personal essays and pick the best one.  Oftentimes you'll be able to use the other ones for supplements.

Mental health days are valid.  If you need to take time off of school for yourself, do it.

Meet with your teachers and tell them how you are feeling. They are understanding, amazing people who will help you in any way they can.

Take notes during information sessions (when a college representative  comes to visit RCDS)
